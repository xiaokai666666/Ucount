The purpose of writing this Android APP is to avoid bordering of ads. Every time when we try to doing bookkeeping, we only need to open the APP, write down what we have spent / earned, then close it. The whole process may takes only several seconds. But many other APPs ask us see an ad when we open them. It is a waste of time.

## Compiling

If you want to compile the application by yourself, just download it and open with Android Studio with default settings, then click `run/debug`. The application with run on your selected devices.
Or you can try to use the APK in the release page.

## Execution

Install the application and click to run.

### Tips
